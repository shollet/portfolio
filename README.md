## Projects
### Sentiment Analysis

Developed a sentiment analysis application for Montreal restaurant customers in **Python**, utilizing Yelp's **API** for data collection and **MySQL** for data storage. The data was processed and tokenized using **NLTK**, structured with **NumPy**, and the analysis model was built and trained via **scikit-learn**. This method produced a word cloud through **Matplotlib**, showcasing prominent sentiment trends and seasonal variations in customer satisfaction levels.

### Text Extraction using NLP

Developped an advanced natural language processing (**NLP**) application using **Java**. The project required building advanced Map classes to store words and track their occurrences in documents. Key tasks involved text preprocessing for NLP, including tokenizing and lemmatizing, and efficiently implementing Map interfaces. Utilizing the **Stanford CoreNLP** library, I focused on managing bigrams for auto-completion and applying TFIDF for enhancing search query relevancy.
